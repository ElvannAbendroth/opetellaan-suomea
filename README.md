# ðŸ’™ Opetellaan Suomea! (Let's Learn Finnish)


Opetellaan Suomea is a language learning tool that allows you to practice Finnish, with a focus on grammar and conjugaisons.

While language learning shouldn't be limited only to grammar practice, Finnish is an exceptionally difficult language to acquire due to the numerous and difficult conjugaisons.

The idea behind this app is to allow conjugaisons to feel easier, and provide a way for students to really focus on improving these skills so they can more confidently use Finnish in real-world scenarios.

Happy practicing!

## Story

This project idea came to me as I first started learning Finnish myself in 2019, as I found declinaisons and verb conjugaisons difficult.  As of 2023, I went back to studying web developement and got familiar with more modern technologies and decided to rebuild the project using NextJS.  As this is mostly a hobby project, I don't have specific long-term plans for it, but as of now it's possible to practice some present and past verb conjugaisons.
