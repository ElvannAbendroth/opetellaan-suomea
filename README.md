# ðŸ’™ Opetellaan Suomea! (Let's Learn Finnish)

Opetellaan Suomea is a language learning application to help Finnish learners with learning and practicing grammar concepts.  This project idea came to me as I first started learning Finnish myself in 2019, as I found declinaisons and verb conjugaisons difficult.  As of 2023, I went back to studying web developement and got familiar with more modern technologies and decided to rebuild the project using NextJS.  As this is mostly a hobby project, I don't have specific long-term plans for it, but as of now it's possible to practice some present and past verb conjugaisons. 

Unfortunately, the first version of the project is not available online anymore, but this verison is.
